SublimeNumberKing
=================

In `SublimeNumberKing`, you manipulate number like a king! The objective of the plugin is to bring spreadsheet features to Sublime Text. After you master this plugin, you can safely uninstall your Excel ;-)

        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
